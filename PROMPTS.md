1. Can you write a Love2D Lua game which features a simple square shape that the player can move around a blank background using the arrow keys?

1. Please update the game so that the green square can only move horizontally on top of a surface, which is represented by a simple line.
The player can use the left and right arrow keys to move the square left and right.
The player should be able to press the spacebar to make the square jump.
When the square jumps, it should fall back to the surface using physics that model the real world.

1. Can you add a few platforms above the main surface, spread out so that the player can jump between them and climb up the screen.
The topmost platform should have a little flag, and when the square touches the flag, a fun victory effect with confetti should play.

1. Update the background to be a checked square pattern with alternating light and dark squares.

1. Can you make the green square that the player moves around look like a simple blue fish?

1. Flip the direction the fish faces when it is moving, and make it bob up and down while it is not jumping.

1. After reaching the flag, draw a little crown on top of the fish, and make the fish strobe different colors.7.

1. Make the fish blink every few seconds, with a random variation.

1. Make the screen shake for a second when the player reaches the goal.

1. Can you please add the ability to double jump?
