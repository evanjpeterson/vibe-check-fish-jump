## Fish Ladder 🐟

The year was 2025, on a Tuesday, and previously I had only heard murmurs and whispers of something referred to as 'vibe coding'.

Whilst perusing Hacker News, I had recently read about an up-and-coming code editor called Zed.

My friend, who is not a programmer but a scientist, discussed some app ideas he'd been dreaming up, and he mentioned that he, too, had been engaged in vibe coding.

This prompted me to download Zed, after which I provided mine Github credentials to it in exchange for access to the free tier and some basic AI agentic coding utility.

Ten prompts later and I was the proud owner of a platforming game that CPE-123 students would be slavering over were we a mere ten years in the past.

And then it continued. My wife even vibe-coded a double-jump input, and she doesn't even know how to enter insert mode in `vim`.
