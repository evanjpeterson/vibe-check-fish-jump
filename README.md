### Fish Jump

The year was 2025, on a Tuesday, and previously I had only heard murmurs and whispers of something referred to as 'vibe coding'.
Whilst perusing Hacker News, I had recently read about an up-and-coming code editor called Zed.
My friend, who is not a programmer but a scientist, discussed some app ideas he'd been dreaming up, and he mentioned that he, too, had been vibe coding.
This prompted me to download Zed, after which I provided mine Github credentials to it in exchange for access to the free tier and some basic AI agentic coding utility.

Ten prompts later and I am the proud owner of a platforming game that CPE-123 students would be slavering over were we a mere ten years in the past.
